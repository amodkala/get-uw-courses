This was a simple script that circumvented some of the more opaque web tools provided by the University of Waterloo and returned a JSON file containing information and metadata for every course offered at UW.

The new version of the academic calendar breaks this script, and I don't think I'll be fixing it any time soon so I'm content to let it serve as a reference for any other scraping scripts I may need to write.
